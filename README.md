# Surface Detection in Ceramic Tiles
This project focuses on identifying surface defects in ceramic tiles using a TensorFlow Lite model deployed via a Streamlit web application. The goal is to automate defect detection and ensure quality control in ceramic tile manufacturing.

## Defect Classes
The model is trained to classify ceramic tile images into the following categories:
- Crack  
- Glue Strip  
- Good (No Defect)  
- Gray Stroke  
- Oil  
- Rough 

## Model Information
Model Type: TensorFlow Lite  
Model Created Using: Google Teachable Machine  

## Deployment
Deployment Platform: Streamlit
